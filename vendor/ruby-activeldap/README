DESCRIPTION
'Ruby/ActiveLdap' is a ruby extension library which provides a clean objected
oriented interface to the Ruby/LDAP[0] library.  It was inspired by
ActivRecord[2]. This is not nearly as clean or as flexible as ActiveRecord, but
it is still trivial to define new objects and manipulate them with minimal
difficulty.

For example and usage - read the rdoc in doc/ from lib/activeldap.rb.
It is also available on the web at:

http://ruby-activeldap.rubyforge.org/
