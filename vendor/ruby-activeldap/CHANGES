  * API CHANGE;
  * Added attributes=() as the implementation for update_attributes(hash) (without autosave)
  * API TRANSITION: Base#write is now deprecated. Please use Base#save
  * API TRANSITION: Added SaveError exception (which is a subclass of WriteError for now)

    - add_objectclass
    - remove_objectclass
    - replace_objectclass

    #   - this would mean cleaner loading I think
  * support ActiveRecord::Validations.
  * support ActiveRecord::Callbacks.
  * rename to ActiveLdap from ActiveLDAP to integrate RoR easily and enforce
    many API changes.

0.7.4:
  * Bugfix: do not base LDAP::PrettyError on RuntimeError due to rescue evaluation.
  * Bugfix: :return_objects was overriding :objects in find and find_all
  * Rollup exception code into smaller space reusing similar code.

0.7.3:
  * Made has_many and belongs_to use :return_objects value
  * Force generation of LDAP constants on import - currently broken

0.7.2:
  * Stopped overriding Conn.schema in ldap/schema - now use schema2
  * Fix attributes being deleted when changing between objectclasses with shared attributes
  * Added schema attribute case insensitivity
  * Added case insensitivity to the attribute methods.
  * Added LDAP scope override support to ldap_mapping via :scope argument. (ldap_mapping :scope => LDAP::LDAP_SCOPE_SUBTREE, ...)
  * Fixed the bug where Klass.find() return nil (default arg for find/find_all now '*')
  * Added :return_objects to Base.connect()/configuration.rb -- When true, sets the default behavior in Base.find/find_all to return objects instead of just the dnattr string.
  * Hid away several exposed private class methods (do_bind, etc)
  * Undefined dnattr for a class now raises a ConfigurationError
  * Centralized all connection management code where possible
  * Added Base.can_reconnect? which returns true if never connected or below the :retries limit
  * Added block support to Base.connection to ensure "safe" connection usage. This is not just for internal library use. If you need to do something fancy with the connection object, use Base.connection do |conn| ...
  * Fixed object instantiation in Base#initialize when using full DNs
  * Added :parent_class option to ldap_mapping which allows for object.parent() to return an instantiated object using the parent DN. (ldap_mapping :parent_class => String, ...)
  * Fixed reconnect bug in Base#initialize (didn't respect infinite retries)
  * Added(*) :timeout argument to allow timeouts on hanging LDAP connections
  * Added(*) :retry_on_timeout boolean option to allow disabling retries on timeouts

  * Fix broken -W0 arg in activeldap.rb
  * attribute_method=: '' and nil converted to ldap-pleasing [] values
  * Added checks in write and search for connection down (to reconnect)
  * Fixed broken idea of LDAP::err2string exceptions. Instead took errcodes from ldap.c in Ruby/LDAP.

0.7.0:
  * ConnectionError thrown from #initialize when there is no connection and retry limit was exceeded
  * ConnectionError thrown when retries exceeded when no connection was created
  * Separated connection types: SSL, TLS, and plain using :method
  * Localized reconnect logic into Base.reconnect(force=false)
  * Fixed password_block evaluation bug in do_bind() which broke SIMPLE re-binds and broke reconnect
  * Add support for config[:sasl_quiet] in Base.connect
  * (Delayed a case sensitivity patch for object classes and attributes due to weird errors)
  * Add :retry_wait to Base.connect to determine the timeout before retrying a connection
  * Fixed ActiveLDAP::Base.create_object() - classes were enclosed in quotes
  * Added :ldap_scope Base.connect() argument to allow risk-seeking users to change the LDAP scope to something other than ONELEVEL.
  * Cleaned up Configuration.rb to supply all default values for ActiveLDAP::Base.connect() and to use a constant instead of overriding class variables for no good reason.
  * Added scrubbing for :base argument into Base.connect() to make sure a ' doesn't get evaluated.
  * Refactored Base.connect(). It is now much cleaner and easier to follow.
  * Moved schema retrieval to after bind in case a server requires privileges to access it.
  * Reworked the bind process to be a little prettier. A lot of work to do here still.
  * Added LDAP::err2exception(errno) which is the groundwork of a coming overhaul in user friendly error handling.
  * Added support for Base::connect(.., :password => String, ...) to avoid stupid Proc.new {'foo'} crap
  * Add :store_password option. When this is set, :password is not cleared and :password_block is not re-evaluated on each rebind.

  * Fix bug reported by Maik Schmidt regarding object creation
  * Added error checking to disallow DN attribute value changes

  * Import() and initialize() no longer call attribute_method=()
  * Added error condition if connection fails inside initialize()
  * Changes examples and tests to use "dc=localdomain"
  * has_many() entries no longer return nil when empty

0.5.9: 
  * Change default base to dc=localdomain (as per Debian default).
  * schema2.rb:attr() now returns [] instead of '' when empty.
  * Lookup of new objects does not put dnattr()=value into the Base on lookup.
  * Scope is now use ONELEVEL instead of SUBTREE as it broke object boundaries.
  * Fixed @max_retries misuse.
  * Added do_connect retries.
  * Fixed find and find_all for the case - find_all('*').
  * Fixed broken creation of objects from anonymous classes.
  * Fixed broken use of ldap_mapping with anonymous classes.

0.5.8: Bugfix galore
  * Allow nil "prefix"
  * Fixed the dup bug with Anonymous patch.
  * (maybe) Fixed stale connection problems by attempting reconn/bind.
  * Hiding redefine warnings (for now)

0.5.7:
  * Fixed the @data.default = [] bug that daniel@nightrunner.com pointed out
    (and partially patched).

0.5.6:
  * Added support for foreign_key => 'dn' in has_many.

0.5.5:
  * Remove @@logger.debug entries during build
  * Building -debug and regular gems and tarballs

0.5.4:
  * Added Base#import to streamline the Base.find and Base.find_all methods
    - Speeds up find and find_all by not accessing LDAP multiple times
      for data we already have.
  * Added tests/benchmark which is a slightly modified version of excellent
    benchmarking code contributed by 
    Ollivier Robert <roberto -_-AT-_- keltia.freenix.fr>.

0.5.3:
  * Changed attribute_method to send in associations
    - fixes belongs_to (with local_kay) and inheritance around that

0.5.2:
  * Make sure values are .dup'd when they come from LDAP

0.5.1:
  * Changed Schema2#class_attributes to return {:must => [], :may => []}
  * Fixed Base#must and Base#may to return with full SUPerclass requirements

0.5.0:
  * API CHANGE (as with all 0.x.0 changes) (towards ActiveRecord duck typing)
    - Base#ldapattribute now always returns an array
    - Base#ldapattribute(true) now returns a dup of an array, string, etc 
      when appropriate (old default) - This is just for convenience
    - Base#ldapattribute returns the stored value, not just a .dup
    - Associations methods return objects by default instead of just names.
      Group.new('foo').members(false) will return names only.
    - Base.connect returns true as one might expect
  * Value validation and changing (binary, etc) occur prior to write, and
    not immediately on attribute_method=(value).
  * Attribute method validity is now determined /on-the-fly/.
  * Default log level set to OFF speeds up 'speedtest' by 3 seconds! 
    (counters last point which added some slowness :)
  * Added Schema2#class_attributes which caches and fully supertype expands
    attribute lists.
  * Integrated Schema2#class_attributes with apply_objectclass which automagically
    does SUP traversal and automagically updates available methods on calls to
    #attributes, #method_missing, #validate, and #write
  * Added 'attributes' to 'methods' allowing for irb autocompletion and other
    normal rubyisms
  * Moved almost all validation to Base#validate to avoid unexpected exceptions
    being raised in seemingly unrelated method calls. This means that invalid 
    objectClasses may be specified. This will only be caught on #write or 
    a pre-emptive #validate. This goes for all attribute errors though.
    This also makes it possible to "break" objects by removing the 'top'
    objectclass and therefore the #objectClass method...

0.4.4:
  * Fixed binary subtype forcing:
    - was setting data as subtype ;binary even when not required
  * Added first set of unit tests.
    - These will be cleaned up in later releases as more tests are added.
  * Fixed subtype clobber non-subtype (unittest!)
    - cn and cn;lang-blah: the last loaded won
  * Fixed multivalued subtypes from being shoved into a string (unittest!)
    - an error with attribute_input_value

0.4.3:
  * Fixed write (add) bugs introduced with last change
    - only bug fixes until unittests are in place

0.4.2:
  * Added ruby-activeldap.gemspec
  * Integrated building a gem of 'ruby-activeldap' into Makefile.package
  * Added attr parsing cache to speed up repetitive calls: approx 13x speedup
    = 100 usermod-binary-add calls
      - Without attr parsing cache:
        real    13m53.129s
        user    13m11.350s
        sys     0m7.030s
      - With attr parsing cache:
        real    1m0.416s
        user    0m28.390s
        sys     0m2.380s

0.4.1:
  * Schema2 was not correctly parsing objectClass entries.
    - This is fixed for now but must be revisited.

0.4.0:
  * Added #<attribute>(arrays) argument which when true
    always returns arrays. e.g.
       irb> user.cn(true)
       => ['My Common Name']
    This makes things easier for larger programming tasks.
  * Added subtype support:
    - Uses Hash objects to specify the subtype
      e.g. user.userCertificate = {'binary' => File.read('mycert.der')}
    - Added recursive type enforcement along with the subtype handling
    - This required overhauling the #write method. 
      - Please report any problems ASAP! :^)
  * Added automagic binary support
    - subtype wrapping done automatically
    - relies on X-NOT-HUMAN-READABLE flag
  * Added LDAP::Schema2 which is an extension of Ruby/LDAP::Schema
    - made Schema#attr generic for easy type dereferencing
  * Updated rdoc in activeldap.rb
  * Updated examples (poorly) to reflect new functionality
  * Added several private helper functions

0.3.6:
  * Fixed dn attribute value extraction on find and find_all
    - these may have grabbed the wrong value if a DN attr has
      multiple values.
  * Fixed Base.search to return all values as arrays and update
    multivalued ones correctly
  * Lowered the amount of default logging to FATAL only

0.3.5:
  * Moved to rubyforge.org!

0.3.4:
  * Changed license to Ruby's

0.3.3:
  * Changed Base.search to return an array instead of a hash of hashes
  * Change Base.search to take in a hash as its arguments

0.3.2:
  * Bug fix - fixed support for module'd extension classes (again!)

0.3.1:
  * Updated the documentation
  * Fixed ignoring of attrs argument in Base.search
  * Fixed mistake in groupls (using dnattr directly)
  * Fixed a mistake with overzealous dup'ing

0.3.0:
  * MORE API CHANGES (configuration.rb, etc)
  * Major overhaul to the internals!
    - removed @@BLAH[@klass] in lieu of defining
      class methods which contain the required values. This
      allows for clean inheritance of Base subclasses! Whew!
    - Added @@config to store the options currently in use
      after a Base.connect
    - Now cache passwords for doing reconnects
    - dnattr now accessible to the outside as a class method only
  * Added Base.search to wrap normal LDAP search for convenience.
    - This returns a hash of hashes with the results indexed first by
      full dn, then by attribute.

0.2.0:
  * API CHANGES:
    - Extension classes must be defined using map_to_ldap instead of setting
      random values in initialize
    - Base#find is now Base.find_all and is a class method
    - Base.find returns the first match a la Array#find
    - force_reload is gone in belongs_to and has_many created methods
    - hiding Base.new, Base.find, and Base.find_all from direct access
  * added uniq to setting objectClass to avoid stupid errors
  * fixed new object creation bug where attributes were added before the
    objectclass resulting in a violation (Base#write)
  * fixed attribute dereferencing in Base#write
  * fixed bug with .dup on Fixnums
  * methods created by has_many/belongs_to  and find and find_all now take an
    optional argument dnattr_only which will return the value of dnattr for
    each result instead of a full object.
  * Base.connection=(conn) added for multiplexing connections
  * Added a manual to activeldap.rb which covers most usage of Ruby/ActiveLDAP
  * Base.connect(:try_sasl => true) should now work with GSSAPI if you are
    using OpenLDAP >= 2.1.29

0.1.8:
  * .dup all returned attribute values to avoid weirdness
  * .dup all assigned values to avoid weirdness
  * Changed default configuration.rb to use example.com

0.1.7:
  * Added support for non-unique DN attributes
  * Added authoritative DN retrieval with 'object.dn'

0.1.6:
  * Added Base.close method for clearing the existing connection (despite Ruby/LDAP's lack of .close)

0.1.5:
  * Fixed incorrect usage of @klass in .find (should .find be a class method?)

0.1.4:
  * Change WARN to INFO in associations.rb for has_many

0.1.3:
  * Fixed class name mangling
  * Added support for classes to take DNs as the initialization value

0.1.2:
  * Patch from Dick Davies: Try SSL before TLS
  * Log4r support
  * Better packaging (automated)
  * Work-around for SSL stupidity
    - SSLConn doesn't check if the port it connected to is really using SSL!

0.1.1:
  * Dynamic table class creation
  * SASL/GSSAPI disabled by default - doesn't work consistently

0.1.0:
  * Added foreign_key to has_many
  * Added local_key to belongs_to
  * Added primary_members to Group example

  * Packaged up with setup.rb
  * Added RDocs and better comments

0.0.9:
  * Separated extension classes from ActiveLDAP module
  * Cleaned up examples with new requires

0.0.8:
  * Added user and group scripting examples
    - usermod, userls, useradd, userdel
    - groupmod, groupls

0.0.7:
  * Cleaner authentication loop:
    - SASL (GSSAPI only), simple, anonymous
  * Added allow_anonymous option added (default: false)

0.0.6:
  * Write support cleaned up
  * Exception classes added

0.0.5:
  * LDAP write support added

0.0.4:
  * MUST and MAY data validation against schema using objectClasses

  * Associations: has_many and belongs_to Class methods added for Base

0.0.1:
  * Extension approach in place with example User and Group classes

0.0.0:
  * Basic LDAP read support in place with hard-coded OUs
